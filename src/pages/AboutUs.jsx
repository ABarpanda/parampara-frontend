          About Parampara
        </h1>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For thousands of years, rituals and traditions have been passed down through generations.
          Our grandparents and ancestors preserved these practices not through books or digital
          archives, but through stories, memory, and lived experience. These traditions often
          existed long before anyone could trace their origins — sometimes spanning centuries.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          As we move deeper into the digital age, the way knowledge is shared has changed.
          Information now lives on screens instead of being passed through conversations.
          While this brings accessibility, it also distances us from the intimate,
          family-based transmission of culture that once defined us.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Traditionally, rituals were sacred and closely guarded within families. However,
          modernization and globalization have softened these boundaries. As cultures blend and
          societies grow more interconnected, the uniqueness of age-old traditions risks being
          forgotten.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          India, in particular, is a land of immense cultural diversity. It is often said that
          every 100 kilometers brings a new language, a new custom, and a new way of life.
          Even when traditions appear similar, small differences make each family’s practices
          unique and deeply personal.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <span className="font-semibold">Parampara</span> exists to honor and preserve that
          uniqueness. It is a space where traditions can be documented, shared, and rediscovered.
          You may even find that a ritual followed in your home mirrors one practiced elsewhere —
          a reminder that our roots may be more connected than we realize.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In an era where nuclear families are common and children grow up far from their
          grandparents, stories and traditions risk fading away. Parampara is our effort to
          preserve these stories — not as relics of the past, but as living knowledge for future
          generations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          For many, contributing to Parampara is an act of remembrance and respect.
          A way to safeguard the wisdom, values, and legacy of those who came before us —
          so their stories continue to live on.
